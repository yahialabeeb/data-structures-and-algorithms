# Hashtables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs, the basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value.

## Challenge
write the code for the basic four methods 

## Approach & Efficiency
add: 
Time O(1)
space O(1)
get:
Time O(n)
space O(1)
contin:
Time O(n)
space O(1)
hash:
Time O(1)
space O(1)
## API
1. add: adding the key and its value to the table 
2. get: get the value using key 
3. contin: check if the key is the table
4. hash: convert the key from str to a intger
