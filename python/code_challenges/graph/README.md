# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge
implement the basic method in graph

## Approach & Efficiency
### add node
time: O(1)
space: O(1)

### add edge
time: O(1)
space: O(1)

### get nodes
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

### get neighbors
time: O(n)
space: O(1)

### size
time: O(1)
space: O(1)


## API
### add node
* add an vertex to the graph
### add edge
* Adds a new edge between two vertex in the graph

### get nodes
* Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

### get neighbors
* Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node

### size
retern the number of element in the graph
