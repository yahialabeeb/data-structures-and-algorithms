# Stacks and Queues

* They are a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
* Stack concepts:

FILO => First In Last Out

LIFO => Last In First Out

* Queues concepts:

FIFO => First In First Out

LILO => Last In Last Out
## Challenge
* Umderstanding the Satck and Queue 
* create tests that ensure that methods are workink right -see them at API-

## Approach & Efficiency
space O(1)
time O(n)
## API
### Stack 
* Push() - Nodes or items into the stack.
* Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack.
* Peek - viewing the value of the top Node in the stack.
* IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
### Queue 
* Enqueue - adding Nodes or items to the queue.
* Dequeue - removing Nodes or items from the queue.
* Peek - view the value of the front Node in the queue.
* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
